Script used in "A framework for restoration of ecological processes derived from trophic interactions"

## Files
The file [Species_potential_effect.R](Species_potential_effect.R) contains the script for the theoretical
examples of the framework (Figure 1 from the main text and Figures 1 and 2 from the Supplementary Material).

The file [Example_case_study.R](Example_case_study.R) containts a basic script to be used when using the
framework with real data as well as the script used in the case study presented in the paper.

## Data
The data used in the case study are separeted in two files. [PlantTraitsPNT.csv](PlantTraitsPNT.csv) 
contains information on the traits from fruiting plant species (i.e. resource community) in Tijuca
National Park. [ConsumersPNT.csv](ConsumersPNT.csv) contains information of the interactions between
frugivores and plants in Tijuca National Park. Both data frames were only used in the 
[Example_case_study.R](Example_case_study.R).
